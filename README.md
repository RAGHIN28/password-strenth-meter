## 🛠️ How to Run Locally

### Method 1 — Quick (open directly)
1. Open the folder `projects/password-strength-meter/src` (or `src`).
2. Double-click `index.html` to open in your browser.

### Method 2 — Recommended (local server)
If you have Node & Angular installed, run in the project folder:
```bash
npm install
ng serve
# open http://localhost:4200
```
(If you don't know these, just open index.html — it's fine.)

## 📦 Technologies Used
- **Angular** (project structure)
- **HTML/CSS/TypeScript**

## 📝 Notes
- Keep screenshots in `/screenshots` — not inside `docs/`.
- `docs/` is generated by the build — do not modify the files there.
- If you want I can improve CSS or rework the UI.
